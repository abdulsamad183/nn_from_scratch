# **4-Layered Neural Network Demonstration**

This project demonstrates the implementation and working principles of a 4-layered neural network, focusing on custom code for activation functions and back-propagation. The model is built from scratch and its performance is compared to a TensorFlow-based implementation, using a generated dataset for training and evaluation.

## **Objectives**
- To build a 4-layered neural network from scratch and understand its key components, such as activation functions and back-propagation.
- To train the custom neural network on a generated dataset and test its performance on an independent test set.
- To implement the same model using TensorFlow and compare the performance between the custom implementation and the TensorFlow version.

## **Results**
The custom and TensorFlow models were trained on the same dataset and tested on an independent test set. Below are the training and testing accuracies for both models:

| **Model**     | **Training Accuracy** | **Testing Accuracy** |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Scratch**   | 99.45%                | 100%                 |
| **TensorFlow**| 99.97%                | 100%                 |

The results show that both implementations achieved excellent performance, with the TensorFlow model slightly outperforming the custom model in terms of training accuracy.
